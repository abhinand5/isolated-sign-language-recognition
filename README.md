## Dataset Description
Deaf children are often born to hearing parents who do not know sign language. Your challenge in this competition is to help identify signs made in processed videos, which will support the development of mobile apps to help teach parents sign language so they can communicate with their Deaf children.

This competition requires submissions to be made in the form of TensorFlow Lite models. You are welcome to train your model using the framework of your choice as long as you convert the model checkpoint into the tflite format prior to submission. Please see the evaluation page for details.
